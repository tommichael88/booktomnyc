## 1. Introduction
By accessing and using the services provided by the Service Provider either through directly contacting Service Provider or by scheduling service through [BookTOM.NYC](https://booktom.nyc) or [Setmore Appointments](https://booktom.setmore.com), the Client agrees to the terms and conditions outlined in this Agreement. The Client acknowledges that they have full and comprehensive insurance coverage, which extends to anyone impacted by the service they are requesting. The Service Provider operates under the assumption that the Client is fully insured and will not accept responsibility for any work where this is not the case as permitted by law. **The Service Agreement is not valid for services booked through third party referal platforms (sometimes known as "match maker" services) of which both Client and Service Provider are bound by the third party referal platform's terms of service .**
## 2. Definitions
- **Service Provider**: Refers to Tom Kongerslev or alias Thomas Kongerslev, offering handyman and tech services.
- **Client**: Refers to the individual (or individuals) utilizing and/or requesting services performed by the Service Provider.
- **Services**: Refers to handyman, tech, and computer services provided by the Service Provider.
- **Job**: Refers to the entire scope of work or project that the Client has requested. This encompasses all tasks, services, and other related activities required to complete the Client's request from start to finish.
- **Work**: Refers to the physical or digital actions, efforts, and activities performed by the Service Provider to fulfill a specific task, service, or job.

## 3. Scope of Services
The Service Provider will provide the Client with the services as mutually agreed upon in writing. The detailed scope of each service is provided in Annex A.

## 4. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

## 5. Service Providers Status
The Service Provider is not a licensed contractor or tradesperson (e.g., plumber or electrician) and does not claim to be. The Client should not request work requiring such professional status by law. The Service Provider is not obligated to accept tasks needing specialized skills, licensing, insurance, or permits. For work in New York, the Service Provider follows legal handyman standards. If the Client requests non-standard work, Client assumes responsibility for and  accepts all risks resulting from such work as permitted by law. The Client must confirm work requirements and compliance with the law, failing which, is at the Client's risk and legal responsibility.
## 6. Hold Harmless Clause
The Client agrees to insure, hold harmless, and indemnify the Service Provider from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses, including legal fees, arising from the services provided under this Agreement. However, this clause shall not be construed to transfer or shift any liability imposed by law from the Service Provider to the Client or any other third party.

## 7. Limitation of Liability
Any damages, losses, or liabilities arising from the Service Provider's work shall not exceed the amount the Client paid for those services.

## 8. Quality of Work and Guarantee
The Service Provider commits to performing services that meet the agreed-upon standards and benchmarks as outlined throughout. The Service Provider guarantees the quality of the work for a period of 30 days from the completion date.

If, within this 30-day period, the work does not meet the specified standards or a previously addressed problem reoccurs due to no fault of the Client or external factors (e.g., natural disasters, third-party interventions), the Service Provider agrees to return and rectify the issue.

This guarantee covers:

  - **Labor performed by the Service Provider.**
  - **Materials used, unless otherwise specified.**

Exceptions to this guarantee include:

- **8-1**: Situations where additional parts or materials are required.
- **8-2**: Misdiagnosis of the initial problem leading to unforeseen complications.
- **8-3**: Significant hardware failures or issues beyond the initial service scope.
- **8-4**: In cases where additional costs arise, the Service Provider will provide a detailed estimate. Any additional labor costs will be discussed and agreed upon with the Client before proceeding.

- **10-3**: Any payment, whether in full or partial, made by the Client to the Service Provider for services rendered is considered an acknowledgment and acceptance of the terms of this Agreement.

Payment for the service, either in full or partial, is a binding provision of this Agreement.
- **10-4**: The relationship between the Service Provider and the Client is on an "at-will" basis. The Service Provider is not an employee, agent, or representative of the Client.

    - At-Will Relationship: Both parties understand and agree that the relationship established by this agreement is "at-will," meaning either party can terminate the relationship at any time, with or without cause. This agreement does not create a long-term employment relationship between the parties.
- **13-9**: Dissatisfaction and Obligations
	- In the event that the Client is dissatisfied with the completed work or encounters any issues related to the services provided, the Client acknowledges that their responsibilities, including but not limited to maintaining comprehensive insurance coverage, shall remain in full force and effect. The Client's dissatisfaction or any problems arising from the services shall not absolve the Client of their obligations under this Agreement. The Client is still responsible for fulfilling all their duties and commitments as outlined in Sections 13-1 through 13-8, regardless of any disputes or concerns related to the services rendered. Failure to meet these responsibilities shall not release the Client from any liability or obligations under this Agreement.

- **18-3**: If a satisfactory resolution is not achieved following the above steps, the Client shall refuse to pay for any or part of the services until such resolution is met.

## 19. Media Policy and Client Feedback Ownership

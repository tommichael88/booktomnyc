## 1. Introduction

**The Service Agreement is not valid for services booked through third-party referral platforms (sometimes known as 'matchmaker' services) for which the Parties are bound by such third-party referral platform's terms of service or contract.**

**Parties**: This Service Agreement ("**Agreement**") is between Tom Kongerslev, an alias for Thomas Kongerslev, henceforth known as the "**Service Provider**," and the client, referred to as "**Client**," whose details will be specified upon booking.

**Consent and Electronic Signature Acknowledgment**: To complete the booking process, the Client must provide consent by selecting the checkbox accompanying the statement "I agree to the Service Agreement." This selection, along with clicking the "Book" button, is required to finalize the booking. Failure to give consent will prevent the booking from being finalized. Checking this box constitutes an electronic acknowledgment and signature of the Client, affirming agreement to the terms and conditions within the Service Agreement. This electronic signature is legally binding and carries the same legal effect as a handwritten signature in accordance with electronic signature laws.

**Effective Date**: This Agreement becomes effective when the Client consents to it by selecting the "I agree to the Service Agreement" checkbox and clicking the "Book" button during the online booking process.

**Location and Accessibility of Agreement**: This Agreement can be accessed online in two primary ways. Within the online booking interface provided by Setmore, the words "Service Agreement" in the consent statement "I agree to the Service Agreement" serve as a hyperlink, leading directly to the Agreement's full text. This hyperlink is uniquely available during the booking process and is not present elsewhere on the Setmore site. Additionally, the Agreement is continuously available, independent of the booking process, at the direct URL [https://tommichael88.github.io/booktomnyc/ServiceAgreement](). The Service Provider's scheduling system is accessible at [https://booktom.setmore.com](https://booktom.setmore.com) and via the redirect URL [booktom.nyc](https://booktom.nyc). These links are for booking purposes and do not direct the user immediately to the Agreement text.

**Retention of Agreement Copy**: The Client may retain a copy of this Agreement for their records by printing the document when reviewing prior to finalizing the booking process, directly from https://tommichael88.github.io/booktomnyc/ServiceAgreement and/or by requesting a copy via email at [booktom@icloud.com](mailto:booktom@icloud.com). Upon request, a copy of the Agreement will be sent to the Client via email.

**Terms of Agreement**: By affirming this Agreement, the Client acknowledges having read, understood, and agreed to the terms and conditions as detailed in the online document.

By accessing and using the services provided by the Service Provider either through directly contacting Service Provider independent of any third party platform or match-maker referal companies or by scheduling service through [Setmore Appointments](https://booktom.setmore.com), the parties agree to the terms and conditions outlined in the Agreement. The Client affirms that they possess full and comprehensive liability insurance coverage, which they also confirm extends to anyone affected by the service they are requesting of the Service Provider. The Service Provider is not required to verify the aforementioned insurance policy however the Service Provider operates under the assumption that the Client is fully insured and will not accept responsibility for any work if this is not the case where permitted by law.

For work in New York, the Service Provider follows legal handyman standards.

The Client must confirm work requirements and compliance with the law, failing which, is at the Client's risk and legal responsibility.

## 6. Hold Harmless Clause

The Client agrees to insure, hold harmless, and indemnify the Service Provider from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses, including legal fees, arising from the services provided under this Agreement.

## 8. Quality of Work and Guarantee

This guarantee covers:

- **18-3**: If a satisfactory resolution is not achieved following the above steps, the Client shall refuse to pay for any or part of the services until such resolution is met. In the event a civil agreement, either as a refund or non-payment for services, would satisfy the Service Provider's end of the agreement and fulfill their obligations.

## 19. Media Policy and Client Feedback Ownership
